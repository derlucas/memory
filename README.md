# memory alpha processing sketch

I wrote this simple program in processing for the Play "Memory Alpha oder Die
Zeit der Augenzeugen" premiere at Schauspiel Dortmund 6th April 2018.

This programm displays a configurable Grid of Square Images like a memory Game.

Put your images within the "images/" folder in the sketch directory. JPG and PNG
files are supported. You can store and load presets with your image selection.
